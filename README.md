# Automated-Personality-Classification

The Automated Personality Classification project employs machine learning and the Big Five Personality Traits model to predict individual traits. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Sklearn, and NumPy, the project preprocesses and formats data for analysis. Multiple algorithms, including decision trees and logistic regression, are applied for personality prediction. Matplotlib and Django are utilized to create visually informative displays of insights derived from the data in an accessiblewebinterface.
